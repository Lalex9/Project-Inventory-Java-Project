<h1 align="center"> Project Inventory</h1>

Project Inventory is a prototype application developed in JavaFX as a school project. It enables user registration with an unique account, saving the products for every user in a different table in the database.

It is not a very complex application due to the time available for developing it for the Java course at university, but it could be easily developed further.
